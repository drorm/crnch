A bookmarklet to crunch a web page by removing all vowels from the text.

In Hebrew, we mostly don't bother with vowels. We just know from context what vowels are needed in each word. I was curious to see what English would look like without vowels, so I created this bookmarklet that removes vowels on a page except when they're capitalized .

Should also work on other languages using a latin alphabet except that it won't take out out accented vowels.
